Tired of having to hammer blocks multiple times just to get the slope or half block you want? Well then Hammer Mode is the mod for you!
Hammer Mode allows you to select which slope a block should be hammered to.

All you have to do is press the configured hotkey (mouse 2 / right click by default) while holding any hammer to bring up a grand design-like menu.
Simply click on one of the options to select a mode.
An icon will be shown next to your cursor to show which mode is currently selected.
To disable hammer mode, select the currently enabled mode in the menu again. When hammer mode is disabled, hammers will regain their vanilla Terraria behaviour.

Hammer mode also features a 'only-break-walls' mode. When this mode is enabled you can't hammer any blocks and can only break walls.
When another mode is active, breaking walls will be prevented.

This mod should be compatible with other mods. Please let me know if you find any issues.
